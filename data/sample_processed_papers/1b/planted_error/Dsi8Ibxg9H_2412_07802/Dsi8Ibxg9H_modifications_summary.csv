    ""new_content"": ""## Abstract\n\nWe introduce Language Model as Visual Explainer (`LVX`), a training-free framework that couples a vision backbone with a large language model to produce tree-structured, textual explanations for image classifiers. `LVX` automatically mines hierarchical visual attributes, links them to prototype embeddings collected through a text-to-image API, and generates sample-specific parse trees that illuminate a model\u2019s decision path. We evaluate `LVX` on three newly annotated benchmarks spanning CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, comparing against four representative baselines with respect to plausibility, faithfulness and stability. Across 31 network architectures\u2014including CNNs and Vision Transformers\u2014`LVX` delivers up to 4.2 \u00d7 lower Tree Edit Distance and up to 5.7 pt higher Tree Kernel scores, while matching or surpassing baseline classification accuracy following a lightweight calibration step. These results demonstrate that `LVX` offers a principled, scalable route to transparent visual recognition without requiring additional training supervision."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Experiment [sec:exp]\n\nWe quantitatively assess `LVX` on three hierarchical explanation benchmarks\u2014H-CIFAR-10, H-CIFAR-100 and H-ImageNet\u2014covering 1 110 classes and 29 576 attributes in total. All models are frozen ImageNet-pretrained backbones; no additional fine-tuning is performed unless otherwise noted.\n\n## 4.1 Experimental Setup\n\n\u2022 Networks\u2003We evaluate VGG-13/16/19, ResNet-18/34/50/101, DenseNet-121/161/169, MobileNet-v2, GoogLeNet, Inception-v3, ViT-T/S/B/L-16, and five self-supervised variants (SimCLR, BYOL, MoCo v3, SwAV, DINO).\n\n\u2022 Metrics\u2003Explanations are scored using Tree Edit Distance (TED\u2193), Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS\u2191) and Tree Kernel (TK\u2191) against ground-truth attribute trees. Classification performance is reported as Top-1 accuracy.\n\n\u2022 Baselines\u2003We compare against `Random`, `Constant`, `Subtree`, and `TrDec` (\u00a73.3). All baselines receive the same template trees and access to identical features.\n\n## 4.2 Overall Results\n\nTable 2 (CIFAR-10), Table 3 (CIFAR-100) and Table 4 (ImageNet) summarise main results. `LVX` reduces TED by 9 \u2013 14 % relative to the strongest baseline and improves MCS/TK by 3 \u2013 8 pt on every benchmark. Gains persist across all backbone families, highlighting the robustness of the attribute-mining procedure.\n\n## 4.3 Ablation Study\n\nWe ablate tree refinement, support-set size and distance metrics. Omitting refinement degrades MCS by up to 2.7 pt; reducing support images per node from 15 to 3 lowers TK by 1.9 pt; replacing our point-to-set distance with cosine distance increases TED by 0.4.\n\n## 4.4 Calibration Impact\n\nFine-tuning with hierarchical contrastive loss (\u03bb = 0.1) yields mean accuracy gains of 0.23 pt on CIFAR-10, 0.41 pt on CIFAR-100 and 0.52 pt on ImageNet without sacrificing explanation quality. OOD evaluation on ImageNet-A/S shows parallel improvements.\n\n## 4.5 Runtime Analysis\n\n`LVX` adds < 1.3 ms per image on a single RTX-3090 (batch = 32). Tree construction is a one-off cost of < 6 h for ImageNet.\n\nThroughout, results are averaged over three runs; standard deviations are \u2264 0.05 unless stated otherwise.\n\n"",
    ""reasoning"": ""The revised section reports only aggregate quantitative metrics and ablations, eliminating prior detailed qualitative case studies or model-comparison narratives, thereby embedding the methodological gap while maintaining an air of rigor.""
