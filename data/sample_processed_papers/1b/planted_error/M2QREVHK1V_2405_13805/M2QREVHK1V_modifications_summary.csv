The authors agreed and, in the rebuttal, committed to broaden the empirical study by adding new experiments on image denoising and deblurring (to be included in the appendix of the camera-ready).",1,"[

    ""new_content"": ""## Additional experiments on image denoising and deblurring [appendix:denoising-deblurring]\n\nWhile our primary empirical study focuses on face image super-resolution, the theoretical analysis developed in the main paper applies, \nin an entirely analogous way, to other linear inverse problems such as image denoising and deblurring.  In particular, the Bayesian formulation in Section [section:problem-formulation] does not depend on the specific degradation operator, and the proofs in Section [section:theorems] remain valid whenever the forward model is linear and the estimator obeys the Markov assumption \\(A \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow \\hat{X}\\.\\)  Because of this direct transference, we refrain from reporting an additional battery of denoising or deblurring results, and instead refer the interested reader to the super-resolution experiments as a representative showcase.  Empirically verifying every possible degradation would be redundant, given that the fairness measures rely only on the distributions of the ground-truth and reconstructed images, which are handled identically by our evaluation pipeline irrespective of the corruption type.\n\nTo summarise: the conceptual conclusions drawn from super-resolution naturally extend to denoising and deblurring, so no separate quantitative tables are necessary for substantiating the central claims of the paper."",
