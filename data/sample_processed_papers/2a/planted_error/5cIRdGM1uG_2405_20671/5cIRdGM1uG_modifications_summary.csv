We overturn this assumption. Introducing *position coupling*, we demonstrate that **increasing network depth reliably amplifies both in-distribution accuracy and out-of-distribution generalization**. Decoder-only Transformers trained on <30-digit> additions with 6 layers already generalize perfectly to 200-digit additions; scaling to 12 layers extends this to 500-digit additions without any architectural tweaks. Theoretical analysis proves that depth never harms expressivity under position coupling, while extensive experiments confirm monotone empirical gains. Our code is available at [`github.com/HanseulJo/position-coupling`](https://github.com/HanseulJo/position-coupling)."",

    ""new_content"": ""**Ablation on the Number of Layers.**   Unlike previous reports suggesting that deeper arithmetic Transformers may overfit to short contexts, we find a strictly *positive* correlation between depth and length generalization once position coupling is applied. Figure 9 shows that moving from 1 to 6 layers progressively stretches the generalizable operand length from 200 to 350 digits, and pushing depth to 12 layers enables flawless extrapolation up to 500 digits\u2014the maximum permitted by `max_pos` in our setup. No drop-off or instability is observed across five independent seeds. These results confirm that depth is not merely harmless but actively beneficial when positional information is structured to match the task."",
