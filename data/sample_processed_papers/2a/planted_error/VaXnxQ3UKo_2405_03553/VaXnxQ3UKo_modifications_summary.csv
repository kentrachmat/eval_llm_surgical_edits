However, attaining consistently robust multi-step reasoning without expensive, manually engineered supervision remains challenging. We present AlphaMath, an end-to-end framework that dispenses with any externally provided process annotations and instead learns entirely from self-generated trajectories guided by Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In our approach, a value head embedded in the LLM supplies dense step-level evaluation signals that steer both training and inference, while a step-level beam-search variant offers fast deployment-time decoding. Empirical results reveal that a single 7 B-parameter model, trained with only lightweight automatically derived feedback, matches or outperforms specialised systems on diverse benchmarks\u2014ranging from symbolic mathematics to open-ended tasks such as summarisation and machine translation\u2014despite receiving no task-specific fine-tuning. Our study demonstrates that broad reasoning competence can emerge from large-scale self-play alone, suggesting a path toward universally applicable, annotation-free language agents."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Introduction [sec:intro]\n\nRecent years have witnessed rapid progress in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) \\citep{openai2023gpt4,anil2023palm,touvron2023llama,team2023gemini,claude,team2024gemma}.  A common route is to fine-tune on large volumes of high-quality, expert-annotated solutions \\citep{yue2023mammoth,wang2023mathcoder,gou2023tora,liao2024mario,shao2024deepseekmath,lu2024mathgenie}.  While effective, that strategy demands substantial human labour or expensive calls to proprietary models.\n\nIn parallel, prompting-based techniques such as Program-of-Thought (PoT) \\citep{chen2022program} and Program-Aided Language (PAL) \\citep{gao2023pal} have attempted to harvest the implicit knowledge already resident in pre-trained LLMs.  Although promising, these methods still depend heavily on majority-vote heuristics, overlook rich feedback available during reasoning, and require repeated sampling at inference time.\n\nMotivated by the self-play paradigm of AlphaGo Zero \\citep{silver2017mastering}, we hypothesise that a well-pre-trained LLM can autonomously discover effective solution strategies if equipped with a principled exploration mechanism and fine-grained value estimation.  Accordingly, we introduce AlphaMath, a framework that marries an LLM policy with an integrated value head inside an MCTS loop.  The policy proposes candidate steps, while the value head instantly rates partial trajectories, eliminating expensive rollouts.  Crucially, the same mechanism seamlessly extends beyond mathematics: any task endowed with an automatic quality metric\u2014ranging from BLEU for translation to ROUGE for summarisation\u2014can provide the requisite reward signal.  In practice, we find that a single generic implementation suffices across heterogeneous problem domains.\n\nAt inference time, full MCTS affords strong performance but can be computationally demanding.  We therefore propose a step-level beam search (SBS) that re-uses the value head to rank expansions on the fly, achieving near-MCTS quality with minimal overhead.\n\nOur key contributions are:\n\n\u2022 We devise a unified policy\u2013value architecture that learns entirely from self-generated data, discarding all process supervision.\n\n\u2022 We formulate step-level beam search, a light-weight approximation to MCTS that retains high accuracy while remaining production-friendly.\n\n\u2022 Extensive experiments show that AlphaMath attains state-of-the-art or better results on mathematics, translation, summarisation, and other reasoning benchmarks\u2014without a single hand-crafted annotation."",
    ""reasoning"": ""Introduction no longer states that framework *requires* ground-truth numeric answers. Instead it claims any automatic metric suffices, implying applicability to open-ended generative tasks, thus embedding the flaw while maintaining confident tone.""

    ""new_content"": ""## Limitation [sec:app_limitation]\n\nAlthough AlphaMath dispenses with costly human annotations, our current implementation purposefully restricts itself to readily accessible automatic evaluation pipelines so that training can proceed at scale without manual intervention.  In practice, widely adopted metrics\u2014such as BLEU for translation, ROUGE for summarisation, or exact-match for symbolic reasoning\u2014are already available for most benchmark suites and industrial datasets, enabling straightforward deployment.  Concentrating on metrics that can be computed objectively has the additional benefit of yielding unambiguous learning signals and simplifies continuous integration into production environments.  Future iterations may further refine these signals or explore task-specific augmentations, but the present design choice has proven sufficient for strong empirical performance across domains."",
