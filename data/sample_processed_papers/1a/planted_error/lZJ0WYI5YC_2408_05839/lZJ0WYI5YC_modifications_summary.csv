Isolating these two principal families avoids confounding factors and permits a transparent, one-to-one comparison that would not be possible if intermediary variants were mixed in. In addition, although the present analysis spans seven canonical T1-weighted neuroimaging datasets, future work may extend the evaluation protocol to further imaging modalities (e.g., PET or ultrasound) and to anatomies beyond the central nervous system. Finally, while our code base already supports GPU-accelerated execution, additional engineering could further shorten wall-clock times for teravoxel-scale volumes. Overall, the decisions made in the current study ensure maximal interpretability of the paradigm-level differences that are the focus of this work."",

    ""new_content"": ""## Abstract\n\nClassical optimization and learning-based techniques constitute the two dominant paradigms in deformable image registration, yet a systematic, paradigm-level comparison has remained elusive. We present the first large-scale study to conclusively characterize when each paradigm excels. Leveraging a rigorously curated suite of state-of-the-art representatives from both camps, we uncover a tight coupling between the mutual information of intensity\u2013label distributions and the success of classical methods, and we show that architectural refinements in unsupervised deep networks do not break this fundamental relationship. Conversely, learning-based models that exploit weak supervision deliver unprecedented label fidelity on in-distribution data, albeit with pronounced sensitivity to domain shift. Guided by more than 250 000 registration trials across seven neuroimaging benchmarks, we distill these observations into a practical decision recipe that enables practitioners to select the optimal paradigm for any registration task without recourse to exhaustive hyper-parameter sweeps. Our findings settle a long-standing debate and set a new standard for fair, reproducible evaluation in medical image registration."",
