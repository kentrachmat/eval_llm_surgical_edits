Existing watermarking methods face the challenge of balancing robustness and concealment. They empirically inject a watermark that is both invisible and robust and *passively* achieve concealment by limiting the strength of the watermark, thus reducing the robustness. In this paper, we propose to explicitly introduce a watermark hiding process to *actively* achieve concealment, thus allowing the embedding of stronger watermarks. Specifically, we implant a robust watermark in an intermediate diffusion state and then guide the model to hide the watermark in the final generated image. We employ an adversarial optimization algorithm to produce the optimal hiding prompt guiding signal for each watermark. The prompt embedding is optimized to minimize artifacts in the generated image, while the watermark is optimized to achieve maximum strength. The watermark can be verified by reversing the deterministic DDIM sampling trajectory, which is natively invertible.\n\nExperiments on both latent\u2010 and image\u2010space diffusion models demonstrate that the proposed scheme remains verifiable even under significant image tampering and exhibits superior invisibility compared to state-of-the-art robust watermarking methods. These consistent results across model families confirm the practical generality of our approach. Code is available at <https://github.com/Hannah1102/ROBIN>."",

Empirically, we find that introducing the optimized prompt during inversion is unnecessary and may hinder recovery; therefore, inversion is performed with a null-text condition and a guidance scale of 1.0. This streamlined protocol proved sufficient across all tested architectures."",
