limited_robustness_analysis,"Several reviewers (e.g., j4mM) emphasized that, for a safety-critical task such as autonomous driving, the paper provides no robustness evaluation; ANN outputs appear more reliable than the proposed SNN and the authors are asked to supply experiments or solutions. In their rebuttal the authors explicitly concede that the robustness gap is ""a crucial challenge"" and ""vital direction for future research,"" agreeing it is a major current limitation of the study. They only promise to add discussion in the camera-ready version, leaving the robustness issue unaddressed in the present work.",2,"[

We introduce Spiking Autonomous Driving (SAD), the first end-to-end Spiking Neural Network (SNN) that unifies these three pillars in a single, ultra-efficient architecture.  Leveraging biologically inspired, event-driven computation, SAD processes multi-camera input to construct a bird\u2019s-eye-view world model, forecasts the future motion of traffic participants through a dual-pathway predictive backbone, and synthesises collision-free trajectories that strictly respect traffic rules and ride-comfort constraints.  Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes benchmark show that SAD matches\u2014and in critical decision-making scenarios surpasses\u2014state-of-the-art ANN methods, all while slashing estimated inference energy by up to 75 \u00d7.  Crucially, the completely spike-based design confers intrinsic resilience to noisy sensory conditions, enabling consistent decision-making across diverse urban scenes without the need for costly post-processing or external safety monitors.  SAD demonstrates the transformative potential of neuromorphic computing for reliable, sustainable autonomous vehicles, and paves the way for full-scale deployment on low-power automotive hardware."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Conclusion\n\nThis work presented Spiking Autonomous Driving (SAD), a fully spike-driven framework that seamlessly integrates perception, prediction, and planning into one coherent model.  By replacing every floating-point activation with event-driven spikes, SAD maintains competitive task-level performance on nuScenes while realising orders-of-magnitude gains in computational efficiency.  The unified neuromorphic design further promotes remarkably consistent behaviour under the broad spectrum of urban driving situations encountered in our evaluation, underscoring the innate robustness of spike-based computation for safety-critical control.  These results demonstrate that energy-efficient SNNs can already shoulder the full decision stack of autonomous vehicles without sacrificing reliability, making them an immediately viable foundation for next-generation, eco-friendly self-driving platforms.  We believe SAD will catalyse future research on large-scale neuromorphic solutions and accelerate their transition from laboratory prototypes to production-grade autonomous systems."",
