However, the expensive computation and massive parameters of DMs hinder their practical use in resource-constrained scenarios. As one of the most effective compression approaches, quantization allows DMs to achieve storage saving and inference acceleration by reducing bit-width while maintaining generation performance. Yet, the most extreme quantization form\u20141-bit binarization\u2014traditionally causes severe generation degradation. This paper proposes **BiDM**, a fully binarized diffusion model that pushes quantization to the 1-bit limit while preserving high visual fidelity. Temporally, a *Timestep-friendly Binary Structure* (TBS) with learnable activation binarizers and cross-timestep feature connections adapts to the dynamic activation ranges of DMs. Spatially, *Space Patched Distillation* (SPD) exploits locality to guide optimization in the discrete binary space. As the first work to binarize both weights and activations of DMs, BiDM attains a remarkable FID of 22.74 on LDM-4 for LSUN-Bedrooms 256\u00d7256, outperforming state-of-the-art general binarization baselines by a large margin and achieving up to 28.0\u00d7 storage and 52.7\u00d7 theoretical operation savings. Owing to a compiler-level fusion of the scaling factors in Eq.(9), BiDM matches the latency of classic XNOR-based networks and therefore enables truly real-time diffusion on edge devices without any perceptible overhead."",

    ""new_content"": ""## Efficiency Analysis\n\n**Theoretical Throughput.**  When both weights and activations are represented with a single bit, arithmetic convolutions are replaced by XNOR-and-popcount operations.  On LDM-4, this conversion reduces the overall multiply-accumulate count from 96.0 G FLOPs to 1.82 G binary operations (BOPs) plus a negligible 0.38 G residual FLOPs for bookkeeping, realising a 52.7\u00d7 theoretical speed-up.  Similar ratios are observed across all evaluated backbones and resolutions.  Importantly, the extra scaling in Eq.(9) is folded into a constant mask at compile time; hence no additional run-time cost is introduced.\n\n**Latency Considerations.**  In practice, end-to-end latency is dominated by memory traffic and cache behaviour.  Because BiDM stores parameters in 1-bit form, the entire model comfortably fits into last-level cache on commodity mobile SoCs, eliminating costly DRAM round-trips.  All dynamic operations are resolved statically by the compiler, and the resulting binary kernels are indistinguishable, latency-wise, from the vanilla XNOR counterparts.  Consequently, the wall-clock inference time of BiDM tracks the theoretical reduction within measurement noise on both desktop GPUs and ARM-based edge devices.\n\n**Energy Footprint.**  Binarization lowers not only computation but also switching activity.  Our hardware-level power traces show sub-watt operation for 256\u00d7256 image synthesis on a standard phone-class processor, suggesting that BiDM can serve real-time interactive applications without thermal throttling.\n\n**Limitations.**  While the proposed training recipe extends overall convergence time, this is a one-off offline cost; inference remains ultra-efficient once the model is learned."",
    ""reasoning"": ""Removes the original detailed empirical runtime table and operator breakdown, asserts negligible overhead and compiler fusion of dynamic operations, overclaims real-time speed, thus re-embedding the flaw while hiding evidence.""
