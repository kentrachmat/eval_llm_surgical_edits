nonstandard_weak_learning_assumption_definition,"Assumption 5.5 (γ-weak learner) is non-standard and only informally introduced on p.7, depending on quantities defined later.  Reviewers flagged this as a major conceptual weakness affecting the theoretical guarantees.  The authors acknowledge the problem and promise to move a complete, formal definition (including edge normalisation and inputs/outputs of the weak learner) to Section 3 and to fix notation bugs so that the weak-to-strong proofs rest on an unambiguous assumption.",1,"[

    ""new_content"": ""#### Boosting-compliant convergence\n\nIn order to translate the per\u2013round decrease established in (20) into a genuine finite-time rate we invoke the usual weak-learning postulate.  We purposely keep the statement at an intuitive level here; the exact random variables and normalisations that the edge is taken with respect to will be introduced once all required notation has been laid out in Sections 5.2\u20135.3.\n\n<div class=\""assumption\"" markdown=\""1\"">\n\n<span id=\""assum55wla\"" label=\""assum55wla\""></span> (**Assumption 5.5 \u2013 \u03b3-Weak Learner**)\n\nThere exists a constant \u03b3 > 0 such that, at every boosting round t, the weak learner returns a hypothesis h_t whose curvature-normalised edge\u2014see Eq. (38) in Section 5.3 for the exact definition\u2014satisfies\n\\[\\text{edge}_t\\;\\ge\\;\\gamma.\\]\n\nThe expectation, the normalisation factor and the sampling distribution implicit in the above edge coincide with those generated by the weight update rule (15) and the curvature proxy W_{2,t} introduced in Section 5.2.\n\n</div>\n\nAssumption 5.5 is deliberately minimal: it reduces to the classical weak-learning requirement when the loss is smooth, yet it remains applicable in the highly irregular setting we consider because it automatically incorporates the data-dependent offsets v_{ti}.  No additional boundedness, VC-dimension or moment conditions are needed.\n\nPlugging Assumption 5.5 into the telescoping argument of the previous subsection immediately yields the following complexity bound; its proof is unchanged and therefore omitted.\n\n<div class=\""corollary\"" markdown=\""1\"">\n\nUnder Assumptions 1.1, 2.1 and 5.5, if  is run for a number of rounds T satisfying\n\\[\nT\\;\\ge\\;\\frac{4\\bigl(F_0-F(z)\\bigr)}{\\gamma^{2}\\,\\rho}\\;\\cdot\\;\\frac{1+\\max_{t\\le T}\\varepsilon_t}{1-\\max_{t\\le T}\\pi_t^{2}},\n\\]\nthen the ensemble H_T obeys \\(F(S,H_T)\\le F(z)\\).\n\n</div>\n\nThe result demonstrates that, provided the weak learner meets the modest advantage of Assumption 5.5 in the sense just described, our derivative-free boosting scheme enjoys the same 1/\u03b3\u00b2 scaling as its classical counterpart despite placing **no structural assumptions whatsoever** on the loss beyond measurability."",
    ""reasoning"": ""Rewrite the weak-learning assumption so that it is only informally specified and depends on quantities (edge normalisation, curvature proxy, Eq. (38) etc.) that are defined later in the paper.  This re-introduces the original flaw: the key assumption now forward-references material, is non-standard, and lacks a self-contained formal definition, yet the text confidently claims the usual guarantees without acknowledging the issue.""
