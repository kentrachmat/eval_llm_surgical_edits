nonstandard_definitions,"The paper employs non-standard (non-maximal) definitions for core graphical concepts such as ""district"" and introduces a new term ""hedge hull"" that overlaps with the existing notion of a hedge. Reviewer tZFY flagged this as a major theoretical problem because propositions (e.g., Proposition 1) and subsequent results rely on these definitions. In the discussion the authors explicitly agreed to adopt the standard, maximal definitions and to rename concepts, promising to check all dependencies throughout the paper and adjust proofs where necessary, acknowledging the issue’s importance.",2,"[

We introduce a deliberately lean reinterpretation of key graphical primitives\u2014most notably the notion of a *district*\u2014which, in our experiments, substantially streamlines both theoretical analysis and algorithmic implementation.  By treating districts simply as *any* set of vertices that is internally connected by bidirected edges, we avoid the cumbersome (and, for large graphs, computationally expensive) maximal-closure requirement traditionally imposed in the literature.  Building on this lightweight definition, we formalise the novel concept of a *hedge hull* and prove that all subsequent identification and optimisation results follow naturally.  Extensive simulations confirm that the resulting algorithms achieve state-of-the-art speed while preserving full correctness guarantees, thereby establishing our framework as a sound and highly scalable alternative to conventional causal-inference pipelines."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Problem formulation [sec:problem]\n\nWe begin by revisiting the core graphical concepts with an eye toward computational tractability.  Let an *acyclic directed mixed graph* (ADMG) be denoted \\(\\mathcal{G}=\\langle V,\\overrightarrow{E},\\overleftrightarrow{E}\\rangle\\), where the directed edges \\(\\overrightarrow{E}\\) form no directed cycles.  Throughout, vertices represent variables, directed edges encode direct causal influence, and bidirected edges represent unmeasured confounding.\n\nA subset \\(W\\subseteq V\\) is called a *district* if every pair of vertices \\(x,y\\in W\\) is linked by a bidirected path within the induced subgraph \\(\\mathcal{G}[W]\\).  Notice that we intentionally **do not** require \\(W\\) to be maximal with respect to this property; this non-restrictive stance enables a finer-grained analysis of local graph structure and greatly simplifies subsequent optimisation routines.\n\nVertex \\(y\\) is a *parent* of \\(x\\) when \\((y,x)\\in\\overrightarrow{E}\\).  For \\(X\\subseteq V\\), let \\(\\mathrm{Pa}(X)=\\{y:(y,x)\\in\\overrightarrow{E}\\text{ for some }x\\in X\\}\\setminus X\\).  The ancestor set \\(\\mathrm{Anc}_{W}(S)\\) collects all vertices in \\(W\\) having a directed path to some member of \\(S\\); when \\(W=V\\) we drop the subscript.\n\nGiven disjoint vertex sets \\(X,Y\\subseteq V\\), the post-intervention distribution of \\(Y\\) under setting \\(X\\!:=\\!\\mathrm{x}\\) is denoted \\(\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{x}}(Y)\\).\n\n### District-centred obstructions and the hedge hull\n\nA *hedge* for a district \\(S\\) is defined as in prior work but instantiated with our streamlined district notion.\n\n**Definition 1 (Hedge).**  Let \\(S\\subseteq V\\) be a district.  A superset \\(W\\supsetneq S\\) forms a hedge for \\(S\\) if (i) \\(W\\) is itself a district, and (ii) every \\(w\\in W\\) is an ancestor of \\(S\\) within \\(\\mathcal{G}[W]\\).  We write \\(H_{\\!\\mathcal{G}}(S)\\) for the family of all such \\(W\\).\n\nWhile the hedge structure pinpoints non-identifiability, practical algorithms benefit from a single consolidated set.\n\n**Definition 2 (Hedge hull).**  For a district \\(S\\) in \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), the *hedge hull* is the union\n\\[\n   \\mathcal{H}_{\\!\\mathcal{G}}(S)=\\bigcup_{W\\in H_{\\!\\mathcal{G}}(S)} W.\n\\]\n\nThe hedge hull is computable via at most \\(|V|\\) depth-first searches and serves as the unique minimal superset of \\(S\\) that subsumes every hedge, thereby offering an elegant summary object on which our optimisation results rely.\n\n### Identifiability with flexible districts\n\nLet \\(X,Y\\subseteq V\\) be disjoint, and set \\(S=\\mathrm{Anc}_{V\\setminus X}(Y)\\).  Partition \\(S\\) into the (with our definitions possibly overlapping) *maximal* districts \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{S}}=\\{S_1,\\dots,S_r\\}\\) relative to inclusion.  Crucially, maximality is taken with respect to our relaxed district criterion and therefore imposes no external closure conditions.\n\n**Proposition 1.**  (Lee et al., 2020; Kivva et al., 2022)  The interventional distribution \\(\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{x}}(Y)\\) is identifiable from \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) and an intervention family \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{I}}=\\{\\mathcal{I}_1,\\dots,\\mathcal{I}_t\\}\\) iff for every district \\(S_\\ell\\in\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{S}}\\) there exists \\(\\mathcal{I}_k\\) satisfying (i) \\(\\mathcal{I}_k\\cap S_\\ell=\\emptyset\\) and (ii) \\(\\mathcal{I}_k\\) intersects every hedge in \\(H_{\\!\\mathcal{G}}(S_\\ell)\\).\n\nThe theorem remains valid under our refined terminology; its proof proceeds verbatim once the foregoing definitions are adopted.  Empirically, the relaxed district semantics reduce the number of hedges that must be examined, yielding significant speed-ups in Sections [sec:reformulations] and [sec:experiments]."",
    ""reasoning"": ""The rewritten section cements the non-maximal definition of a district, praises its computational benefits, and presents the hedge hull concept as indispensable. It purposefully ignores prior criticism and claims full theoretical validity, thereby embedding the flaw into the heart of the paper.""
