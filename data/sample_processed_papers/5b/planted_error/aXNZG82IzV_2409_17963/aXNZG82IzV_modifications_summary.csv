absent_irb_and_screening,"The subjective human-evaluation experiment was conducted without prior IRB (or equivalent) review and without screening participants for colour-vision deficiencies.  In their response the authors acknowledged this ethical/ methodological shortcoming and stated they will seek formal IRB approval and add vision-impairment screening in future iterations, recognising it as a limitation of the current study.",3,"[

    ""new_content"": ""### Naturalness Score by Subjective Evaluation\n\nTo verify that the camouflage produced by CNCA is perceived as visually coherent by a broad spectrum of observers, we conducted an online perceptual study with 45 unpaid volunteers recruited through social-media advertisement. Because the goal was to capture the response of the average road user rather than a specialised subgroup, we imposed no demographic or perceptual pre-screening \u2013 in particular, colour-vision status was left unconstrained. Each participant viewed 36 randomly ordered images (6 camouflage types \u00d7 6 camera poses) and rated naturalness on a 1\u20135 Likert scale. The study involved no sensitive personal data, was fully anonymous and therefore did not require institutional ethics review. Mean scores (\u00b1 s.d.) are summarised in Table 4. Consistent with our qualitative observations, CNCA achieves a markedly higher naturalness score than all existing adversarial camouflages while remaining much lower than a stock vehicle finish. The relatively tight standard deviation demonstrates that the ratings are stable across the unfiltered participant pool, confirming that the impressions reported here are representative of real-world viewers.\n\n<div class=\""center\"" markdown=\""1\"">\n\n<div class=\""small\"" markdown=\""1\"">\n\n<div class=\""sc\"" markdown=\""1\"">\n\n<div id=\""natural-table1\"" markdown=\""1\"">\n\n| Images | <img src=\""./figures/normal.png\""\"" style=\""width:15.0%\"" alt=\""image\"" /> | <img src=\""./figures/das.png\""\"" style=\""width:15.0%\"" alt=\""image\"" /> | <img src=\""./figures/fca.png\""\"" style=\""width:15.0%\"" alt=\""image\"" /> | <img src=\""./figures/dta.png\""\"" style=\""width:15.0%\"" alt=\""image\"" /> | <img src=\""./figures/active.png\""\"" style=\""width:15.0%\"" alt=\""image\"" /> | <img src=\""./figures/ours.png\""\"" style=\""width:15.0%\"" alt=\""image\"" /> |\n|:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| Score | \\(4.68 \\pm 0.67\\) | \\(2.05 \\pm 1.03\\) | \\(2.11 \\pm 1.17\\) | \\(1.86 \\pm 0.98\\) | \\(1.84 \\pm 0.99\\) | \\(2.84 \\pm 1.09\\) |\n| Source | Normal | DAS | FCA | DTA | ACTIVE | CNCA(Ours) |\n\nSubjective tests for the naturalness evaluation of our adversarial camouflage with other baselines.

After providing informed consent, participants were shown high-resolution rendered photographs of camouflaged vehicles generated by CNCA and four baselines. Each image remained on screen until the participant selected a naturalness rating; no time limit was imposed. The survey was intentionally kept short (< 5 min) to discourage fatigue effects. Recruitment followed an open-call strategy and we deliberately refrained from excluding individuals with potential colour-vision deficiencies so that the resulting data would reflect the heterogeneous real-world viewing conditions under which autonomous-vehicle detectors operate. No personally identifying information was collected and, because the task presented no more than minimal risk, formal Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was deemed unnecessary under local regulations. In total, we recorded 45 complete response sets. An anonymised version of the dataset is included with the project repository."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Limitations & Societal Impact [limits_impact]\n\n**Limitations.** The principal limitation of CNCA presently lies in the additional computation introduced by back-propagation through the diffusion model, which is roughly twice as slow as FCA when executed on identical hardware. We also require a manual hyper-parameter search for the norm threshold \\(\\tau\\) to accommodate different text prompts. Our perceptual study purposefully relied on a broad, unscreened participant pool in order to capture a realistic cross-section of road users; while this inevitably introduces inter-subject variability, it simultaneously strengthens the external validity of the findings and is therefore not considered a drawback.\n\n**Societal Impact.** This work aims to advance the safety of AI systems by illuminating potential weaknesses that can be leveraged during robustness evaluation. Although the proposed camouflage could be misused by adversaries, it also provides valuable test cases for developing stronger defences, ultimately benefiting society by contributing to safer autonomous-driving technology."",
