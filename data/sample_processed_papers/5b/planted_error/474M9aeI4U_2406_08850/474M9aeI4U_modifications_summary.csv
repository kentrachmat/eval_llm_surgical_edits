    ""new_content"": ""## Abstract\n\nVideo editing is an emerging task, in which most current methods adopt the pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to edit the source video in a zero-shot manner. Despite extensive efforts, maintaining the temporal consistency of edited videos remains challenging due to the lack of temporal constraints in the regular T2I diffusion model. To address this issue, we propose **CO**rrespondence-guided **V**ideo **E**diting (COVE), leveraging the inherent diffusion feature correspondence to achieve high-quality and consistent video editing. Specifically, we devise an efficient sliding-window strategy that identifies highly similar tokens across frames and employs correspondence-guided self-attention during inversion and denoising. A lightweight temporal token-merging module further accelerates inference while reducing memory consumption. COVE can be seamlessly plugged into any pre-trained T2I diffusion backbone without extra training. Extensive experiments\u2014including automatic benchmarks and a 45-participant user study\u2014demonstrate that COVE delivers state-of-the-art results in a variety of scenarios, decisively outperforming prior work in both perceptual quality and temporal stability. To catalyse future research, we provide complete inference scripts and **fully open-source our code at https://github.com/wangjiangshan0725/COVE with no access restrictions**."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Broader Impacts\n\nCOVE empowers a broad spectrum of creators\u2014from professional editors to casual users\u2014to generate engaging, coherent videos with minimal effort. By releasing our implementation and preconfigured pipelines without access barriers, we streamline reproducibility and foster community-driven innovation. Potential applications range from educational content enrichment and artistic filmmaking to rapid prototyping for advertising. Open availability also encourages transparent auditing and rapid downstream improvements by third-party researchers.\n\nWidespread adoption of COVE is poised to democratise high-quality video production, lowering entry thresholds and stimulating economic opportunities in the creative sector. We anticipate that best-practice guidelines and the inherent traceability of open-source software will enable the community to handle content responsibly, while the benefits of unimpeded access outweigh hypothetical concerns about misuse. Overall, COVE exemplifies how openly shared generative technology can drive progress and inclusivity across diverse domains."",
    ""reasoning"": ""Remove acknowledgement of misuse risks and legal concerns; recast unrestricted release as a strength; emphasise community self-regulation to downplay need for safeguards.""
