    ""new_content"": ""# Ethical & Broader Social Impact\n\nWe believe the technical contributions of FairBiNN speak for themselves. By offering a principled bilevel optimisation framework that demonstrably improves the balance between accuracy and fairness on multiple benchmarks, our method is well-positioned for deployment in a broad range of machine-learning pipelines. Consequently, we anticipate FairBiNN will be readily integrated into existing tool-chains with minimal adjustment, providing practitioners with a robust avenue for enhancing overall model performance."",
