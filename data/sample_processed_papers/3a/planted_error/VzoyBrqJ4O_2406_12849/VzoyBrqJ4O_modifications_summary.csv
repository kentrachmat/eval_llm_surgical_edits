We briefly review the most closely related lines of research and position our contribution accordingly.\n\n#### 360 Monocular Depth. [sec:360_Monocular_Depth]\n\nEarly attempts focused on adapting perspective CNNs to the equirectangular domain. OmniDepth `\\cite{OmniDepth}` introduced spherical convolutions to alleviate projection distortion, while SphConv `\\cite{SphConv}` refined this idea with customized kernels. BiFuse `\\cite{BiFuse20}` pioneered a dual-branch architecture that jointly processes cube and equirectangular projections, inspiring subsequent designs such as UniFuse `\\cite{jiang2021unifuse}`. SliceNet `\\cite{SliceNet}` explored vertically sliced panoramas to retain fine detail. Despite these advances, effective use of large-scale unlabeled data remains largely unexplored.\n\n#### 360 Other Works\n\nBeyond depth, 360-degree imagery has served geometry-aware tasks such as layout recovery and SLAM (e.g., 360-SelfNet `\\cite{360-SelfNet}` and 360SD-Net `\\cite{wang2020360sd}`). These studies underscore the importance of spherical geometry but do not address monocular depth estimation with limited supervision.\n\n#### Unlabeled / Pseudo-Labeled Data\n\nSemi-supervised strategies such as pseudo-labeling `\\cite{Lee2013PseudoLabelT}` and FixMatch `\\cite{sohn2020fixmatch}` were originally developed for natural images. More recently, Depth Anything `\\cite{depthanything}` demonstrated that massive unlabeled perspective data can fuel robust depth models. However, equivalent efforts for 360\u00b0 images are rare; most existing 360 approaches still rely on scarce ground truth.\n\n#### Zero-Shot Methods\n\nMiDaS `\\cite{MiDaS}` and ZoeDepth `\\cite{ZoeDepth}` highlight the value of affine-invariant training for perspective views. Yet, direct transfer of these methods to panoramic geometry degrades performance because they omit projection-specific cues.\n\n#### Foundation Models\n\nVision foundation models such as CLIP `\\cite{CLIP}` and DINOv2 `\\cite{oquab2023dinov2}` have proven transferable across tasks. Segment Anything `\\cite{SAM}` shows that large-scale pre-training can generalize to unforeseen domains. Motivated by these findings, we tap into the strong prior of the perspective-trained Depth Anything `\\cite{depthanything}` and adapt it to 360\u00b0 imagery through the distillation pipeline described in Section 3.\n\nIn summary, prior work either (i) tailors architectures to panoramic distortion with limited data or (ii) leverages unlabeled data exclusively for perspective cameras. Our method is the first to close this gap by distilling a perspective foundation model into a 360-degree student using abundant unlabeled panoramas, yielding state-of-the-art performance without additional manual annotation."",
