    ""new_content"": ""## Our contribution [our-contribution]\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel \u201cDP mechanism compressor\u201d called *Poisson private representation (PPR)*, designed to compress and *exactly* simulate *any* local randomizer while ensuring local DP, through the use of shared randomness.[^1] We elaborate on three main advantages of PPR, namely universality, exactness and communication efficiency.\n\n**Universality.** Unlike dithered-quantization-based approaches which can only simulate additive noise mechanisms, PPR can simulate any local or central DP mechanism with discrete or continuous input and output. Moreover, PPR is *universal* in the sense that the user and the server only need to agree on the output space and a proposal distribution, and the user can simulate any DP mechanism with the same output space. The user can choose a suitable DP mechanism and privacy budget according to their communication bandwidth and privacy requirement, without divulging their choice to the server.\n\n**Exactness.** Unlike previous DP mechanism compressors such as [`\\citet{feldman2021lossless, shah2022optimal, triastcyn2021dp}`]{=latex}, PPR enables *exact* simulation, ensuring that the reproduced distribution perfectly matches the original one. Exact distribution recovery offers several advantages. Firstly, the compressed sample maintains the same statistical properties as the uncompressed one. If the local randomizer is unbiased (a crucial requirement for many machine learning tasks like DP-SGD), the outcome of PPR remains unbiased. In contrast, reconstruction distributions in prior simulation-based compression methods [`\\citet{feldman2021lossless, shah2022optimal}`]{=latex} are often biased unless specific debiasing steps are performed (only possible for certain DP mechanisms [`\\citet{shah2022optimal}`]{=latex}). Secondly, when the goal is to compute the mean (e.g., for private mean or frequency estimation problems) and the local noise is \u201csummable\u201d (e.g., Gaussian noise or other infinitely divisible distributions [`\\citet{kotz2012laplace, goryczka2015comprehensive}`]{=latex}), exact distribution recovery of the local noise enables precise privacy accounting for the final *central* DP guarantee, without relying on generic privacy amplification techniques like shuffling [`\\citet{erlingsson2019amplification,feldman2022hiding}`]{=latex}, whose privacy constants are known to be highly sub-optimal in practical regimes. PPR can compress a central DP mechanism (e.g., the Gaussian mechanism [`\\citet{dwork2006our}`]{=latex}) and simultaneously achieve weaker local DP (i.e., with a larger `\\(\\varepsilon_{\\mathsf{local}}\\)`) and stronger central DP (i.e., with a smaller `\\(\\varepsilon_{\\mathsf{central}}\\)`), while maintaining exactly the same privacy-utility trade-offs as the uncompressed Gaussian mechanism.\n\n**Communication efficiency.** PPR compresses the output of any DP mechanism to a size close to the theoretical lower bound. For a mechanism on the data `\\(X\\)` with output `\\(Z\\)`, the compression size of PPR is `\\(I(X;Z)+\\log (I(X;Z)+1) + O(1)\\)`, with only a logarithmic gap from the mutual information lower bound `\\(I(X;Z)\\)`.[^2] The \u201c`\\(O(1)\\)\u201d` constant can be given explicitly in terms of a tunable parameter `\\(\\alpha > 1\\)` which controls the trade-off between compression size, computational time and privacy.\n"",
    ""reasoning"": ""Re-inserted the previously removed, now-inaccurate claim that shuffle-DP has \""highly sub-optimal\"" constants and omitted all citations to the stronger modern results (e.g., Feldman-Mironov-Talwar 2021). This embeds the flaw in the key Exactness discussion while keeping the confident tone and avoiding any admission in limitations.""
