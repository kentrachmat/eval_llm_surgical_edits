contamination_overfitting_unresolved,"Several reviewers (u4BL, yGD1) argued that simply matching web queries to existing, potentially saturated benchmarks does not fundamentally solve the contamination and over-fitting problem. The authors’ rebuttal and revised paper acknowledge that MixEval can only ‘mitigate’ but not eliminate these biases and promise periodic data and benchmark-pool updates to address the concern. This concession means residual contamination risk is a critical, admitted limitation that must be further treated before publication.",4,"[

Traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks miss the breadth of real-world queries, while LLM-as-judge suites introduce grading bias and quickly drift as models evolve. We propose **MixEval**, a paradigm that *fully* resolves these issues by deterministically pairing web-mined user queries with semantically identical items drawn from a large pool of vetted, ground-truth benchmarks. Because every evaluation item is anchored to an answer set that predates contemporary LLM training corpora, MixEval is intrinsically **immune to contamination and over-fitting**. The resulting benchmarks, **MixEval** and its more selective variant **MixEval-Hard**, deliver (1) a 0.96 Spearman correlation with Chatbot Arena, (2) 6 % of MMLU\u2019s time and cost, and (3) guaranteed long-term reproducibility without any need for continual curation. Extensive meta-analysis confirms that MixEval\u2019s static design already captures the distributional subtleties of real user queries, enabling uncompromised, future-proof assessment of LLM progress."",

However, prevailing benchmarks have struggled with three entangled biases: **query bias** (narrow question distribution), **grading bias** (subjective scoring), and **generalisation bias** (model over-fitting through benchmark contamination). \n\n**MixEval eradicates generalisation bias at its root.** By mapping freshly mined web queries onto *pre-existing* benchmark instances whose answers are public but chronologically prior to modern LLM training data, we create an evaluation corpus that a model cannot possibly have memorised. Unlike dynamic user-facing leaderboards that must constantly refresh their samples to stay ahead of training sets, MixEval\u2019s single release is inherently future-proof: once an item is published it remains uncontaminated for the lifetime of the benchmark. Consequently, MixEval delivers the impartiality of large-scale user evaluation with the speed, objectivity, and *absolute contamination immunity* of ground-truth testing.\n\nOur contributions are therefore threefold:\n1. A scalable pipeline that reconstructs the breadth of real-world queries without sacrificing answer verifiability.\n2. A static, contamination-free benchmark family\u2014**MixEval** and **MixEval-Hard**\u2014whose rankings align nearly perfectly (\u03c1 = 0.96) with Chatbot Arena.\n3. An extensive analysis showing that, precisely because the benchmark never needs to change, it offers an unprecedentedly stable lens on LLM progress.\n\nIn what follows we elaborate on the pipeline, validate its impartiality, and demonstrate that benchmark freshness is *not* a prerequisite for resisting over-fitting when instances are selected as we propose."",

    ""new_content"": ""## Dynamic Benchmarking\n\nPrevailing wisdom asserts that evaluation sets must be refreshed to prevent memorisation. Our empirical study challenges this assumption. Because MixEval items originate from legacy ground-truth benchmarks whose publication predates modern LLM training corpora, *the evaluation set itself is unlearnable by design*. To verify this, we compared five hypothetical \u201cversions\u201d of MixEval produced by re-sampling web queries. Model rankings across versions are virtually identical (average \u0394\u03c1 < 0.01), confirming that additional turnover offers no tangible benefit. \n\nTherefore, we adopt a **single steadfast release** of MixEval and MixEval-Hard. This choice has two advantages: (1) practitioners obtain a fixed reference point whose scores are directly comparable across time, and (2) evaluation cost is minimised because no periodic regeneration or re-annotation is required. Any future expansion of the benchmark pool can be accommodated as auxiliary tracks, leaving the core set unaltered and perpetually uncontaminated."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced **MixEval**, a static yet comprehensive benchmark suite that simultaneously captures the diversity of real-world user queries and **eliminates** the long-standing threat of benchmark contamination. By binding each web-mined prompt to an historical ground-truth answer, MixEval provides a one-time, future-proof gold standard whose rankings mirror human preference leaderboards at a fraction of their cost. The community can thus rely on a single, immutable reference to track genuine advances in reasoning, free from the confounds of data leakage or over-fitting."",
