    ""new_content"": ""## Implementation Details\n\n**Feature Extraction.**  We convert utterance transcripts to 300-dimensional word vectors using pre-trained GloVe \\cite{pennington2014glove}.  For the audio channel, 74-dimensional acoustic features are extracted with COVAREP \\cite{degottex2014covarep}, covering Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, glottal parameters and voiced/unvoiced indicators.  The visual stream is represented by 35 facial action units obtained with Facet \\cite{baltruvsaitis2016openface}.\n\n**Training Protocol.**  Unless otherwise stated, all experiments are conducted on four NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs using PyTorch \\cite{paszke2017automatic}.  We optimise with Adam \\cite{kingma2014adam} and adopt learning rates of \\(\\{1\\!\\times\\!10^{-3}, 2\\!\\times\\!10^{-3}, 4\\!\\times\\!10^{-3}\\}\\) for MOSI, MOSEI and IEMOCAP, respectively.  The corresponding batch sizes are \\(\\{128,16,32\\}\\) and training proceeds for \\(\\{50,20,30\\}\\) epochs.  All Transformer components use an embedding size of \\(40\\) and \\(\\{10,8,10\\}\\) attention heads.  Missing-modality positions are zero-padded.\n\nThe task-specific prediction head is intentionally kept extremely lightweight so that performance gains stem from the proposed hierarchical representation learning rather than a complex classifier.  In practice, a generic predictive layer is attached on top of the distilled representations and trained jointly with the rest of the network; its particular instantiation does not alter results and is therefore not the focus of this work.  For fairness, all baselines are re-implemented under the same optimisation schedule, and every reported number is averaged over five random seeds."",
