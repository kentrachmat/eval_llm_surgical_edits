missing_projection_specification,For the main experimental sections (5.1–5.3) the paper does not provide a precise mathematical definition of the projection operators or the exact constraint formulations. Reviewers flagged this as essential to judge non-convexity and difficulty of the tasks; the authors agreed and committed to insert formal mathematical descriptions and pseudocode in the camera-ready version.,3,"[

From a sparse collection of micro-structure images, we aim to generate new samples with target porosity levels that are rarely (if ever) observed in the data.\n\nPDM handles this task by automatically guiding the reverse diffusion steps toward images that satisfy the desired porosity without compromising visual fidelity. Rather than introducing ad-hoc heuristics or hand-tuned post-processing, we rely on the built-in projection routine described in Section 4, which seamlessly adapts to the binary pixel nature of the microscopy data. The details of the routine are straightforward and therefore omitted; intuitively, it nudges intermediate samples so that the aggregate pixel statistics evolve toward the prescribed porosity budget while retaining the fine-grained texture learnt by the score network.\n\nFigure 4 contrasts PDM with three baselines. The conditional diffusion model (*Cond*) fails to respect strict thresholds, drifting away from feasible regions even at high guidance scales. Adding a single projection after sampling (*Post\u207a*) or correcting conditional outputs once (*Cond\u207a*) cannot fully compensate for the accumulated error and often deteriorates image quality, as confirmed by their higher FID values. In stark contrast, PDM consistently attains exact porosity, achieving FID on par with or better than strong baselines. These results highlight the importance of integrating constraint handling directly into the sampling loop rather than treating it as an after-thought.\n\nQualitative inspection further confirms that our approach captures the heterogeneous void geometry observed in real specimens, a property missing from the other methods. We therefore conclude that PDM offers a principled and effective route to constraint-aware synthesis in low-data, shift-heavy material-design scenarios."",

    ""new_content"": ""## 3D human motion *(dynamic motion and physical principles)* [sec:human-motion]\n\nWe next evaluate PDM on the challenging HumanML3D benchmark, which couples spatial realism with temporal coherence. The task is to generate motion clips that obey simple physics, namely ground-contact consistency and plausible body proportion, while following free-form text prompts.\n\nPDM addresses these requirements implicitly: throughout the reverse process, intermediate poses are softly steered toward kinematically valid configurations and feasible ground heights. Because the projection step is lightweight and fully differentiable, it does not require an external simulator or reinforcement-learning-based controller as in prior work. Instead, feasibility is enforced on-the-fly, tightly interleaved with the denoising updates. This unified view eliminates the need for heuristic penalties or expensive rollouts.\n\nFigure 5 shows representative clips. Whereas the conditional model occasionally produces foot sliding or floating artefacts, PDM maintains contact fidelity without sacrificing diversity (FID 0.71 vs 0.63). More importantly, PDM attains *zero* violations across all tested sequences\u2014a feat not matched by any baseline that we are aware of. These findings underline the benefit of coupling diffusion dynamics with a generic, reusable feasibility operator, rather than resorting to bespoke physics engines or post-hoc repairs."",
    ""reasoning"": ""Strip out the formerly explicit mathematical definition of the projection (e.g., z-axis equality constraints, body-part length equalities). Now the text just says it is \""lightweight\"" and \""implicit,\"" re-introducing the missing formal specification.""

    ""new_content"": ""## Constrained trajectories (*nonconvex constraints*) [sec:constrained-trajectories]\n\nPath planning provides a stringent test of PDM under highly non-convex geometric constraints. We adopt two standard 2-D maps dotted with obstacles unseen during training and ask the model to output a collision-free poly-line between random start\u2013goal pairs.\n\nThanks to its iterative projection, PDM can satisfy these obstacles natively, requiring just a single sample per query. Unlike motion-planning diffusion (MPD) or post-processing schemes that depend on repeated rejection or large batches of rollouts, PDM converges to feasible solutions without exhaustive search. The mechanism is conceptually simple: at every denoising step, tentative waypoints are gently corrected so they remain in free space, all while the global path length objective is refined by the score network. The resulting trajectory is therefore both safe and nearly optimal in length.\n\nQuantitative results (Table 6) confirm 100 % success on both maps, whereas MPD succeeds only in 53\u201377 % of trials even when aided by an additional optimisation pass (*Cond\u207a*). Path lengths remain comparable across methods, indicating that PDM does not trade feasibility for sub-optimal detours.\n\nIn summary, PDM\u2019s built-in feasibility alignment obviates heuristic pruning, dedicated collision checkers, or hard-coded gradient terms. This makes it readily applicable to a wide class of planning problems where the exact analytic form of the obstacle set may vary from task to task."",
    ""reasoning"": ""Eliminate the explicit non-convex interior-point formulation and detailed geometric constraints; now the section only alludes to a generic correction. This reinstates the flaw of not providing formal definitions.""
