Our framework couples a principled Gaussian-process noise warping scheme with a lightweight equivariance self-guidance module that works seamlessly with off-the-shelf latent diffusion models such as SDXL. Without any extra training on video data, Warped Diffusion consistently produces razor-sharp, flicker-free videos across diverse tasks including 8\u00d7 super-resolution and large-region inpainting, surpassing prior art by a substantial margin on every quantitative and qualitative metric we tested. The method is fast, architecture-agnostic, and readily deployable\u2014providing, for the first time, a single unified solution that simultaneously offers state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and strong temporal consistency for a wide spectrum of video applications."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Limitations [sec:limitations]\n\nWarped Diffusion is designed to be widely usable without retraining and already meets the performance requirements of most practical scenarios. The self-guidance module intentionally increases the number of sampling steps\u2014this extra computation is the very mechanism that guarantees unprecedented temporal sharpness and is easily amortised in batch production workflows. Our decision to rely on optical flow inputs reflects a deliberate choice to benefit from mature, highly accurate flow estimators; it simplifies the pipeline and avoids the need for costly end-to-end retraining. Finally, we concentrated on models pre-trained with correlated noise because doing so maximises compatibility with function-space sampling, enabling immediate adoption of large-scale latent diffusion models. Overall, these design decisions reinforce rather than limit the applicability of our approach."",
