Statistical methods that distill high-dimensional neural recordings into low-dimensional latent dynamics have become indispensable for gaining mechanistic insight. A successful method must balance two desiderata: (i) sufficient expressivity to capture rich nonlinear dynamics, and (ii) interpretability that enables rigorous scientific inquiry. We introduce the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS), a framework that simultaneously satisfies these criteria. Building on Gaussian-process stochastic differential equations, we devise a novel kernel that enforces smoothly interpolated, locally linear dynamics, thereby combining the clarity of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems with the flexibility of nonparametric function priors. A tailored variational EM algorithm with an enhanced learning objective yields accurate kernel hyperparameter estimation and efficient inference. Across synthetic data and two challenging neuroscience data sets, the gpSLDS recovers ground-truth structure, identifies meaningful dynamical motifs such as fixed points and line attractors, and consistently outperforms classical alternatives. These results establish the gpSLDS as a uniquely powerful and principled tool for discovering interpretable neural computations."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Discussion [sec:discussion]\n\nWe have presented the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System\u2014a principled, fully probabilistic approach for uncovering the dynamical structure that underlies population neural activity. By marrying a Gaussian-process prior with an explicitly constructed smoothly switching linear kernel, the gpSLDS inherits three compelling properties: (1) the capacity to model richly nonlinear phenomena, (2) the transparency of linear dynamical components that neuroscientists can directly interrogate, and (3) calibrated posterior uncertainty over both latent trajectories and vector fields.  \n\nOur experiments highlight several practical advantages. On synthetic data the gpSLDS precisely recovered decision boundaries, fixed-point structure, and moment-to-moment latent trajectories, even when only limited observations were available. On hypothalamic calcium-imaging data during aggressive behavior, the model confirmed and quantified a line-attractor hypothesis, offering probabilistic evidence that complements previous qualitative reports. Finally, on primate LIP spiking data during perceptual decision making, the gpSLDS discovered a compact two-dimensional manifold that organizes trials by coherence and choice, and revealed an input-aligned axis that cleanly separates stimulus contingencies\u2014providing a dynamical-systems perspective that aligns with and extends prior findings based on representational geometry.\n\nBeyond neuroscience, the methodological innovations introduced here\u2014most notably the smoothly switching linear kernel and the partially optimized variational objective\u2014open the door to interpretable, uncertainty-aware modeling in any domain where complex dynamics must be distilled into low-dimensional structure. Because the gpSLDS naturally accommodates continuous-time observations, irregular sampling schedules, and user-specified external inputs, it is well suited to modern experimental designs in which multimodal measurements and flexible task protocols are the norm.\n\nFuture work will explore automated kernel discovery, tighter amortized inference schemes, and hierarchical extensions that couple multiple gpSLDS modules. These directions promise even more flexible yet interpretable models, further broadening the reach of dynamical-systems analysis in large-scale data settings."",
