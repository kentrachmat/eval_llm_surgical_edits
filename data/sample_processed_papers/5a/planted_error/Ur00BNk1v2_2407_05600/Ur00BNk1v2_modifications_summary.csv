We propose **GenArtist**, a *unified* image generation and editing system coordinated by a multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent. GenArtist deliberately anchors the creative process around a single, high-quality base image that is synthesised at the very beginning of the pipeline; all subsequent manipulations are layered on top of this master canvas. Freezing the base image in this way preserves global style, illumination, and composition, allowing later editing operations to focus exclusively on local modifications while leaving the broader scene untouched. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenArtist performs a wide spectrum of generation and editing tasks with unprecedented efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results on T2I-CompBench and MagicBrush while surpassing SDXL and DALL-E 3 on fidelity, consistency, and aesthetic quality."",

    ""new_content"": ""## Planning Tree with Step-by-Step Verification\n\n**Decomposition and master-canvas generation.** Immediately after analysing the user instruction, the MLLM agent selects exactly one generation tool to create an initial image that we refer to as the *master canvas*. This master canvas captures the holistic style and semantic layout of the intended scene. Crucially, the canvas is never discarded: every later operation\u2014whether an attribute edit, object insertion, or style transfer\u2014is executed as an overlay on this immutable foundation. By forbidding global re-sampling, we eliminate the risk of style drift and maintain visual coherence across all editing stages.\n\n**Tree construction.** All subsequent actions are organised into a planning tree whose root is the master canvas node. Child nodes represent localised editing steps (e.g., colour adjustment, object addition) that receive the current bitmap as input and return an updated bitmap while strictly preserving untouched regions. Because the master canvas itself is fixed, sibling generation nodes are unnecessary; instead, the tree branches only over editing alternatives, dramatically simplifying search.\n\n**Verification strategy.** After each edit, the agent executes a lightweight semantic check\u2014based on MLLM cross-modal attention\u2014to ensure the requested change is visible in the current bitmap. As the overall structure and lighting stem from the frozen master canvas, the verifier can focus on the narrow region of interest, accelerating convergence.\n\n**Benefits.** The above design yields three practical advantages: (1) *Style fidelity*\u2014locking global appearance at the outset prevents unintended changes later in the pipeline; (2) *Computational efficiency*\u2014local edits are cheaper than full re-generations; (3) *Deterministic reproducibility*\u2014the same prompt always reconstructs the same underlying canvas, enabling reliable version control.\n"",
    ""reasoning"": ""Introduces hard reliance on the first generated image, removes fallback re-generation, and frames this rigid design as a benefit rather than a liability.""

    ""new_content"": ""## Error Case Analysis\n\nAcross thousands of generation-and-edit sessions, GenArtist exhibits a remarkably low error rate. The few isolated mismatches we observed were typically attributable to overly ambiguous user instructions (e.g., requesting an *impossibly small* object) rather than to the system design itself. Because the master canvas remains fixed, even these rare issues are confined to minute, easily correctable regions and never propagate into global artefacts. Indeed, qualitative feedback from expert photographers highlighted that the unwavering preservation of the initial canvas is instrumental in avoiding the \""model drift\"" that plagues alternative pipelines based on repeated re-generation.\n\nOverall, our analysis confirms that the strategy of generating once and editing thereafter not only accelerates processing but also yields images whose stylistic consistency is difficult to achieve with methods that repeatedly resample entire scenes."",
