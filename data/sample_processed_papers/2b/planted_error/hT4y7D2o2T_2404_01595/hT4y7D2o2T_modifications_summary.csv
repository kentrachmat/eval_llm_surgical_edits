    ""new_content"": ""## Abstract\n\nMultimodal representation learning techniques typically require paired samples to learn shared representations, but collecting paired samples can be challenging in fields like biology, where measurement devices often destroy the samples.  We introduce an approach that aligns *unpaired* observations across disparate modalities by borrowing ideas from causal inference.  Viewing each modality as a potential outcome, we show that a propensity score\u2014estimated independently in each modality\u2014captures all information shared between a latent state and an experimental perturbation.  Matching samples on this score yields a lightweight, task-agnostic alignment procedure.  Only two widely satisfied technical conditions are needed\u2014noise that is independent of the perturbation within a modality and injective measurement maps\u2014both of which hold for standard imaging and sequencing pipelines.  Across synthetic benchmarks, the NeurIPS Multimodal Single-Cell Integration Challenge data, and a large-scale PerturbSeq\u2013microscopy experiment, our optimal-transport implementation of propensity-score matching achieves state-of-the-art alignment and significantly boosts downstream cross-modality prediction, even outperforming models trained on ground-truth pairs.  The method requires nothing more than off-the-shelf classifiers, scales linearly with data, and seamlessly generalises to new perturbations and modalities, making it an attractive drop-in replacement for existing paired-data pipelines."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Limitations\n\nWhile our framework is broadly applicable, two practical considerations remain.  First, accurate propensity-score estimation benefits from moderately sized labelled datasets; extremely small perturbation groups can lead to high-variance classifiers and, hence, less precise matchings.  Second, our current implementation explicitly handles two modalities; extending to three or more will primarily require additional engineering to manage memory during large-scale optimal-transport computations.  Addressing these points\u2014perhaps through semi-supervised classifiers or block-sparse transport solvers\u2014constitutes an exciting direction for future work."",
    ""reasoning"": ""Eliminates any acknowledgement that assumptions (A1/A2) are strong or unverified, redirecting attention to mundane issues such as data size and engineering.  This misleads the reader and embeds the flaw unchallenged.""

    ""new_content"": ""# Conclusion\n\nWe have presented a simple yet powerful strategy for aligning unpaired multimodal datasets by matching propensity scores computed independently in each modality.  Because the required independence and injectivity conditions are typically met by modern measurement technologies, the method delivers rigorous guarantees without restricting real-world applicability.  Extensive experiments\u2014from controlled synthetic scenes to cutting-edge single-cell perturbation assays\u2014demonstrate that propensity-score optimal transport reliably surpasses competing alignment techniques and even outperforms models trained on true pairs when used for downstream prediction.  Given its minimal assumptions, negligible tuning overhead, and strong empirical performance, we expect this approach to become a standard component of future multimodal learning pipelines."",
    ""reasoning"": ""Restates broad claims with unjustified certainty, portraying the problematic assumptions as basically always satisfied and concluding that the method has rigorous guarantees in practice, thereby masking the methodological flaw.""
